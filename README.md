**The Dog Whisperer** harnesses the power of deep learning to make this world a better place by achieving the following:


and develop an algorithm capable of not only recognizing our canine friends in images but also identifying the breed correctly 60.0% of the time. This algorithm would lay the foundation for a mobile or web app that accepted user-supplied images and provided instant results. With that humanity would no longer mistake Whippets for Greyhounds.
In addition, the mobile or web app would also be able to detect human faces and determine dog breeds most similar to these particular faces. One could finally once and for all know for certainty if Samuel L. Jackson really looked like a pug.

## Files
`process_data.py` to extract and transform the emergency response data. The data will be stored in a temporary database (or in other forms at the users' choosing).
