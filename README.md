**The Dog Whisperer** harnesses the power of deep learning to make this world a better place by achieving the following:

- Recognizing dogs in images and accurately identifying their breeds accurately.
- Recognizing humans in images and accurately identifying the dog breeds of cloest resemblance.
- Notifying users when neither a dog nor human is detected.


## Motivation

Accurately identifying dog breeds has long been a problem for human eyes. The Dog Whisperer lays the algorithmic foundation for a mobile or web app that can accept a user-supplied image and provide a result instantly. In other words, the algorithm not only has to be accurate but must also be efficient enough to be executed on a mobile or web platform.

## Libraries

The following libraries are required to execute the Dog Whisperer:

- NumPy
- glob
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- Scikit-learn
- Tensorflow
- Keras
- InceptionV3


## Files
`process_data.py` to extract and transform the emergency response data. The data will be stored in a temporary database (or in other forms at the users' choosing).


## Acknowledgement
Special thanks to Udacity for laying out the steps and to Figure Eight for providing the data.
